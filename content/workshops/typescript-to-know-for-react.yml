problemStatements:
  part1: Runtime errors are annoying in development
  part2: And they're **devastating** in production
  part3: >-
    You could have 100% automated test code coverage on your entire application
    and _still_ experience a runtime error. Sure is a good thing you've tested
    every permutation of data for every function in isolation and integration
    right? right... 😐
  part4:
    How's the discoverability of your data models? When a developer with
    inexperience in the codebase jumps in, how much time are they console
    logging objects to figure out what properties they've got? Too much time.
    That's the answer.

    description:
      If you've never used TypeScript before, it can seem like an overwhelming
      proposition. It looks a lot like JavaScript, but sometimes it can feel
      like a completely different language. This, combined with perfectionist in
      all of us can result in poorly typed code, so we'll learn some strategies
      of how to adopt TypeScript properly to avoid beginner-you laying waste to
      your codebase.

    description: >-
      I'll give this one to you right now: They're functions for types. That's
      it. Wondering what that even means? Come to the workshop to find out!
  - title: How to properly type React components and hooks
    description:
      Much of what we learn in this workshop will be general TypeScript
      knowledge, but we'll focus on TypeScript topics that are particularly
      applicable to React applications.

    description:
      The TypeScript-experienced among you might chuckle at this one a bit
      because it's true. Sometimes you try everything and just can't seem to get
      rid of those red squigglies. We'll talk about strategies you can employ to
      get those things to go away _without losing type safety_.
